# WorldBuilder
This project is intended to be a kind of gazeteer of fictional worlds. It is intended as an aid to my roleplaying game hobby and a way to practice with various technologies and tools. Initially it will consist of an Eclipse RCP Application interface with local File I/O, hopefully to be extended into a restful webservice and then various other clients currently I am thinking an Android app and/or a Spring MVC Web app.
